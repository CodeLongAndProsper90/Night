## Welcome to Night!

Here's a fully featured ide provided by repl.it where you can code using Night!

Read the instructions below to get started.

---

**How do I get started?**

All you have to do is to write your code in the `source.night` file. As soon as you do that, the page will reload and this repl will automatically fork over to you. If you want to save your progress, create an account on repl.it, and this will fork directly to your account.

Then, hit the `RUN` button to run your code, and you should see the result in the console.

**What do the folders/files do?**

The `Night` folder contains all the code for the language. The `.replit` makes the code work. Don't worry about those two, and don't touch them either!

This file, the `README.md` file is where the instructions are. You can delete this file if you wish.

And most importantly, the `source.night` file is where you'll be writing your code in.
